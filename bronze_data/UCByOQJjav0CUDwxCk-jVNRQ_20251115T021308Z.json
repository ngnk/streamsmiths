        "description": "In a looping hotel hallway, a man opens three doors – to betrayal, distraction, and loneliness – reliving the emotional void of searching for real love in a world of illusions. This treatment tells the story of the emotional disorientation of modern love through the eyes of a man caught in a surreal loop of heartbreak, temptation, and isolation.

Like emotional weight being carried through space and luxery. This video follows a beautiful, magnetic woman as she moves through the empty streets of NYC after dark. The concept is simple, but the tone is anything but. \n\nDirected by Hannah Sider\nhttp://instagram.com/hannahsider\n\nView full 'Somebody Loves Me' submissions here: https://www.drakerelated.com/videos"

This is uniquely positioned puppet-fueled odyssey of lust, status, and late nights told though the detached gaze of Drake and the smooth counterbalance of PND. Together they look for true love as they float through a carousal of indulgent scenes. The women (some real, some puppets) come and go. Some flirt, some dance, some converse… but in the end they are there for superficial reasons.
